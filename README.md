# crazy-eights-cpp

console based implementations of crazy eights (the card game) in c++.

this project has two target implemetations:
* a "pass-and-play" version where all players are on the same terminal on the same computer
* an "over-sockets" version where each player exists on a different terminal on the same or different computers

kind of skipped repository planning, so appropriate branches and tags will be created along the line (definitely before I start working on the over-sockets version)
